1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Great! So, we are doing pretty well. We've delved into general ledgers. We've looked

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
at T-accounts and debits and credits. We learned about the accounting equation

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and about the three main financial statements. That's a pretty good start.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It seems like the right moment to introduce one of the fundamental

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
concepts in accounting, double-entry bookkeeping. The principle behind it is

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that every transaction has equal and opposite effects in two or more

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
accounts. This principle guarantees the satisfaction of the accounting equation.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, every time we register an accounting transaction, we need to think of at least

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
two accounts that will be affected by the transaction. This approach was

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
fundamental back in the day when accounting software programs were not

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
available and accountants needed to be extremely careful in order to avoid

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
mistakes. Today, things are easier because accounting software assists

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
bookkeepers and accountants in recording and reporting on a firm's financial

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
transactions. It is virtually impossible to make an entry without respecting the

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
double-entry principle, as an error message would appear on the screen

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
instantly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the double-entry principle

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because it is at the core of studying accounting. Let's illustrate it with a

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
simple example. Think of a firm that owns only one asset,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
one million dollars in cash. The firm owns only one asset. Good. This is one

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
part of the accounting equation. The other part is liabilities and equity,

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which, if you remember, show us how the company is financed. So, let's suppose

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that this firm is financed entirely through equity, one million dollars of

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
equity. So, the two sides of the equation tell us that one million dollars of cash

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
are financed by one million dollars of equity capital. So far, so good. Let's

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
imagine that the firm buys a real estate property with its one million dollars of

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
cash. What will be the necessary entries that would allow us to respect the

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
double-entry principle? The firm buys real estate assets. We need to draw a new

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
T-account. Let's call it real estate. It is on the asset side. When the company

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
buys the real estate property, the account will increase. It is an asset and

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
we know that we need to debit the real estate account. Okay. This shows that the

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
firm owns real estate for one million dollars. Now, we need to think of the

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
counterpart account. How did the company pay for the asset? With cash, right?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Therefore, we need to make an entry that shows the reduction in cash. Cash is an

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
asset and it decreased in this transaction. Hence, we are going to credit

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the cash account. Okay. This shows that we spent our cash in order to buy the real

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
estate property. You can see how we needed two entries in order to recap the

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
effects of the transaction. The two entries balanced each other. One of them

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
was on the debit side and the other on the credit side. Hence, the accounting

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
equation is still satisfied. Let's make another example. After buying the real

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
estate property, the firm manages to obtain a bank loan for $500,000. What

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
entries need to be made in order to account for this transaction in the

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
balance sheet? First of all, the company received $500,000 in cash. So, we need to

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
increase the cash account. This is an asset. Hence, we will write $500,000 on the

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
left side of the T account. Very good. We debited the cash account. Now, we need to

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
think of a second transaction that will restore the balance in our equation. The

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
firm received a bank loan, right? So, now it owes $500,000 to the bank. We need to

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
show this on the balance sheet. It will be on the right side of the balance

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
sheet, given that it is a liability. It will create a new T account. Bank Loans.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When a liability is increased, it needs to be credited, which means that we need

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to write the number on the right side of the account. $500,000 on the right side

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
of the T account, describing bank loans. Now, the accounting equation is satisfied.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can see the double entry principle helps us satisfy the accounting equation

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
at all times. It is one of the golden rules of accounting. This is why we'll
